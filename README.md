# currencyUpdater
some simple code to automate updating of currency using openexchangerates.com.  you can setup a free account that should be plenty.

uses a named credential in your org called OpenExchangeRates though its not really necessary, as the auth is via an api key 

uses a custom metadata type to store the api key.

i'll pull this all from salesforce and make it installable and usable someday.
just cut and pasted so you can take it and use it
